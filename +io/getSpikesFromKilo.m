% Noise spikes should be excluded from everything; we do this in a moment. 
% Both MUA and Unsorted reflect real spikes (in my judgment) but ones that
% couldn't be isolated to a particular neuron. They could include in
% analyses of population activity, but might include spikes from multiple
% neurons (or only partial spikes of a single neuron. Good clusters are
% ones I judged to be well-isolated based on a combination of subjective
% criteria: how clean the refractory period appeared, how large the spike
% amplitudes were, how unique the waveform shapes were given the
% surrounding context. These things can be quantified using the code at
% (https://github.com/cortex-lab/sortingQuality), but I have not done so
% when making the "Good" versus "MUA" decision. I think that due to the
% data quality and density of sites on these probes, the isolation quality
% is in general extremely good. However you should certainly interpret
% "single neurons" with caution and very carefully examine any effects you find
% that might be corrupted by poor isolation.
